# LoopHeroPronounSwap
 Swapping the gendered language in loop hero to female pronouns and potential gender neutral in the future.

To Install: grab "lang_eng.ini" from release and copy to your "\steamapps\common\Loop Hero\local" folder.  This will overwrite the original translation, so back up the file if you don't want to reverify later.
